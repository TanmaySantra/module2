            Got me wiggin' on you like I'm Arrogant Tae
            You got my mind in a terrible place
            Whipped and chained you like American slaves

            Damn, these niggas got me so twisted
            How the fuck you so real, but play bitch on my line?
            I can feel what you're spinnin'
            Got too much pride to let no burnt nigga slime me out
            Pull up, go write about
            My night, got time, let's discuss all those lies about
            Frontin' out here like you diggin' me out
            And I ain't even cummin', I'm in and out
            And you ain't 'bout the shit you rappin' about
            And I can spin a ho, I'm airin' it out
            I'm goin' off like a sawed-off
            You tell these hoes you ain't cuddlin'
            But with me, you know you doin' all that shit
            You tellin' these hoes you ain't trickin' off
            But with me, you know I'm gon' get it all
            How you niggas get so carried away?
            Trippin' when that dick is barely third place
            Fucked out of pity, it's cute that you lame

            Yeah
            January, you pretend to see life clearly, yearly
            February is the time that you put the evil eye and the pride aside
            For the fantasy of gettin' married, very scary
            March got you already second guessin' titles
            April, spring is here and just like a spring, you start to spiral
            May brings some warmer days, poolside, gettin' very tan
            June have you movin' ice cold, goin' back and forth with a married man
            July, that's when I found out you lied
            August, it was "baby" this, "baby" that like you had your tubes tied
            September, we fallin' off, but I'm still the man you tryna win over
            October is all about me 'cause your turn should've been over
            November got you moodboardin' for next year and you're single
            December the gift-givin' month and now you wanna rekindle our year
            Tryna build trust, showin' me your DMs, how they tryna bag you
            Ironic how the news I got about you ended up bein' bad news
            Get a nigga hit for fifty racks, girl, the beef cost like it's wagyu
            Get a nigga hit, I'll make his ass see the light like a half-moon
            Shout to QC, pretty sure I made Pee M's like it's past noon
            All I really know is W's and M's, life lookin' like a bathroom
            All I really know is M bags like I drove through and ordered fast food
            Sayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings, who the fuck even asked you?
            Seven bodyguards just in case somebody really wanna try and crash through
            Don't know why I listen to you when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half-truths
            If I don't pay your rent, it end up like an old hairstyle, girl, it's past due
            If I don'tâ€”
